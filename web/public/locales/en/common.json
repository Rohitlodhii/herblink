      "q1": "What is botanical traceability?",
      "a1": "Botanical traceability is the process of tracking a plant or herb from its source of origin (the farm or forest) all the way to the final consumer product. This ensures authenticity, quality, and safety.",
      "q2": "Why is traceability important for Ayurvedic herbs?",
      "a2": "Many Ayurvedic herbs look similar and can be easily substituted or adulterated. Traceability guarantees you're getting the correct, potent herb, free from contaminants, and sourced ethically.",
      "q3": "How does your technology work?",
      "a3": "We use a combination of DNA barcoding to genetically verify the plant species and geo-tagging to confirm its origin. Each batch is given a unique code that you can use to view its journey.",
      "q4": "Are your partnered farms organic?",
      "a4": "We prioritize partnerships with farms that follow organic and sustainable practices. You can view the specific certifications for each herb on its traceability report."
